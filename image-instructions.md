# Creating Images for Mystic Memo

To complete your Mystic Memo game, you'll need to create or source the following images:

## 1. mystic-bg.jpg (Background Image)

This is the main background image for your game. It should have a mystical theme.

**Suggested characteristics:**
- Resolution: 1920px × 1080px (or higher)
- Dark purple/blue color scheme with stars or nebula effects
- Subtle enough not to distract from gameplay
- Mystical elements like stars, galaxies, or magical symbols

**Where to get it:**
- Create using image editing software like Photoshop or GIMP
- Use free stock image sites like Unsplash or Pexels
- Generate using AI image generation tools like DALL-E or Midjourney

## 2. card-back.jpg (Card Back Design)

This image appears on the back of all cards before they're flipped.

**Suggested characteristics:**
- Resolution: 300px × 400px
- Mystical symbol or pattern (e.g., pentagram, moon phases, crystal)
- Gradient background with dark blue/purple colors
- Consistent with the game's mystical theme

**Design tips:**
- Keep it simple enough to be recognizable at small sizes
- Avoid too much detail that might be distracting
- Use a design that complements the front symbols

## 3. final-image.jpg (Reward Image)

This is the special image revealed when players complete the game.

**Suggested characteristics:**
- Resolution: 800px × 600px
- Impressive, detailed mystical scene
- Something worth revealing as a reward
- Could be a magical landscape, mystical creature, or cosmic scene

**Ideas:**
- Detailed mystical landscape with magical elements
- Ancient magical artifact or spellbook
- Mystical creature like a phoenix or dragon
- Cosmic scene with planets and stars in alignment

## 4. game-preview.jpg (About Page Preview)

This is a screenshot or mockup of the game for the About page.

**Suggested characteristics:**
- Resolution: 800px × 500px
- Shows the game in action with some cards flipped
- Helps new players understand what to expect

**How to create it:**
- Take a screenshot of your game once it's working
- Edit to show various states of gameplay
- Add annotations if helpful

## Image Optimization

Before adding images to your project:

1. Optimize them for web use to reduce file size
2. Use JPG format for photographs and complex images
3. Consider using WebP with JPG fallback for better performance
4. Aim for file sizes under 200KB for background images
5. Compress images using tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim

## Folder Structure

Place all images in the `images/` directory at the root of your project:

```
mystic-memo/
└── images/
    ├── mystic-bg.jpg
    ├── card-back.jpg
    ├── final-image.jpg
    └── game-preview.jpg
```

## Image Licensing

If using images from stock photo sites:
- Ensure you have proper licensing for web use
- Credit photographers when required
- Keep track of attribution requirements

If creating your own images:
- Consider adding a copyright notice in your footer
- Include licensing information in your README
